                    <strong>Review: </strong> <br></br>
                    Set during the 14th Century in the Muromachi period of Japan, <strong> Princess Mononke </strong> tells the story of Ashitaka, a young prince cursed by the hatred of a dying boar god. The god has been corrupted by an iron ball lodged in its body. Ashitaka embarks on a journey to find a cure for his curse and becomes entangled in a war between the gods of the forest and the humans who exploit its resources. Director Hayao Miyazaki masterfully weaves themes of Shinto spirituality and environmentalism into this visually stunning and emotionally resonant epic. The film's breathtaking animation, complex characters, and thought-provoking narrative make it a timeless classic in Studio Ghibli's repertoire.

                    <strong>Review:</strong><br></br>
                    Set in post-war rural Japan, <strong>My Neighbour Totoro</strong> follows two young sisters, Satsuki and Mei, who move to the countryside with their father to be closer to their hospitalized mother. They discover that the surrounding trees are inhabited by Totoros—magical spirits of the forest. When Mei runs away from home, Satsuki seeks help from these friendly wood spirits to find her. Director Hayao Miyazaki captures the joys of rural living, animism, and the wonder of childhood in this heartwarming tale. Totoro, with its iconic design, has become a beloved cultural icon and the mascot for Studio Ghibli.
